## Portfolio Highlights
### Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management
This project addressed inventory inefficiencies by employing a random forest regression model to forecast demand. Using historical sales data and external variables like seasonality, we built a predictive system integrated into a Tableau dashboard for real-time insights.  
**Impact:** Cut stockouts by 15%, improving customer satisfaction and reducing costs.  
**Code Snippet:**  
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
